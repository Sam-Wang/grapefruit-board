uMeshFw Grapefruit board / debug platform
==============================================

During the last two years of sparse uMeshFw development I noticed that often a problem or a feature
cannot be properly simulated and tested. Most of the development was done on a qNode4 platform,
which (among the others) lacks support for many required peripherals and is not very debug-friendly.
It was (and still is) meant to be used in "production".

Therefore I decided to specify a new debug board / platform which should ease the development
of the uMeshFw firmware and uMesh protocol stack features.

Also, I had a feeling that qNodeX names are a bit boring.


This repository is a Work in Progress and is still incomplete. Full project description can be
